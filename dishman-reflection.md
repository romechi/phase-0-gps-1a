1. What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?  The command steps to update a file on Github. 

2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS? How to make a new branch from terminal using Git checkout -b command 

3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? I learned about markdown and more about pull request. 

4. What still confuses you about Git? There are many commands to still learn while using Git from terminal vs. Github. 

5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? My first experience with pairing was good. My paring partner helped me a lot and positive reinforcement on the basics of Git commands.
